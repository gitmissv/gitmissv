### Hey there! 👋 
I'm Verona, and I recently completed the full-stack code labs bootcamp through <i><a href="https://www.codefiworks.com/codelabs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codefi</a></i> in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. I'm excited to continue this journey into the world of programming and software development. This README serves as a brief introduction of who I am, what I've learned, and what I'm currently working on...
